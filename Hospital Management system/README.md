#HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This team project focused on developing an MVP hospital management system. My specific
role was to document, design and build the 20 APIs required for connectivity to external endpoints. I documented
the APIs and assigned success and failure status codes. I subsequently built these API interfaces and tested them to
ensure they were functional.
