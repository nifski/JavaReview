# Hospital management system

This hospital management system will efficiently manage patients, doctors, appointments, and medical record.
I will be designing and documenting a REST API that provides the endpoints specific to the system using swagger.
I will load a given project on IntelliJ and use it to implement the REST API I designed.
I will use Postman to create two test requests for each endpoint -- success and error responses
