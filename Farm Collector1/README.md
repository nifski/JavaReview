#FarmCollector API

FarmCollector1 is the first version of a data collection and reporting system built to help farmers collect, manage, and analyze planting and harvesting data from farmers—per farm, per field, and per season.

This challenge was given to me as a hands on timely challenge to deepen my understanding of backend development, enhance my data modeling and API design skills as well as documentation skills, and demonstrate my ability to write clean, structured, and maintainable Java code using Spring Boot.


The objective of the assignment-
The goal of this challenge is to design and implement a RESTful API system that enables:

Data collection for:
Crops planted (with area and expected yield)
Crops harvested (with actual yield)
Generation of seasonal reports that compare:
Expected vs actual yield per farm
Expected vs actual yield per crop type (across all farms)

These reports are intended to be displayed on a web interface for use by the organization “FarmCollector.” Here I will show a bit of my creativity when it comes to HTML and CSS

Technologies Used-
Java (Spring Boot)
Spring Data JPA
H2 / PostgreSQL
Swagger / OpenAPI (for API documentation)
Maven / Gradle (build tool)
RESTful architecture
DTO mapping and validation

I find the DTO and validation to be the most interesting piece in this puzzle.

Through this project, I intend to showcase structured and modular code. Readable and maintainable Java code that will enable me to be able to scale in the future as I found this challenge of course challenging but insightful in terms of ways to help farmers with evolving technology and digital solutions. Clean method signatures, descriptive naming, logical flow. Good data modelling. RESTful design rules in terms of proper use of HTTP methods and status codes. Reusable parts — Use of DTOs for clear communication between layers and an attempt at encapsulation.
